# Sportscar


This project was first started with intention in practicing OAuth and MongoDB. 

It was expanded to a sports car dealership-like web site because I like sports cars.

Most of the links are external car dealership's websites at the moment.

Self-built pages include /home, /vehicles, /login, /contact,/protected and /dealers.

I'm tryting to continuosly build new pages with new tech and functionality that I've never used before.

Tech Used: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Express, Node, OAuth, MongoDB Atlas, Heroku.

New techs I encountered to use in this app are OAuth - passport(github, google+ strategy), MongoDB (Atlas, mongoose), and nodeMailer.

Not all CRUD functionality is implemented yet. The cars in /vehicles are read from mongoDB atlas.

To do list for now:

finish up the /dealer page - google-map

add to garage button function in /vehicles - which adds vehicles to user 
set up the MongoDB and back end apis for users and vehicles

later I can turn this project into a car forum or blogs ... etc
